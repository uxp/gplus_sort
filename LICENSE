Someone asked me about a License.

Do whatever you want. Sell it, steal it, print copies and burn
them, I don't care. I hacked this together in an hour (Google,
why you use convoluted class names?) and has quite a few values
hard-coded in it (element class names), which I expect to have
break within the week as Google pushes new code and fixes bugs.

If you fix bugs in it, cool. If it doesn't work for you, then
fix some bugs. Thanks to Google for throwing me back into
vanilla JS to get this done. I'll be in the corner cuddled up
in my jQuery blanket pretending my head doesnt hurt.

No warranty is given with this code, at all, not even implied.
